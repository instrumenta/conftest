# Conftest documentation

The documentation for Conftest is stored as markdown files in this directory, and a documentation site generated using [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

Conftest provides a `Pipfile` for managing the required dependencies. At the top level of this repository (ie. _not_ in the `docs` directory) run:  

```console
pipenv install
```

With the dependencies installed you can run the site locally. Any modifications to the files in `docs` will be automatically rebuilt.

```console
pipenv run mkdir serve
